# BatchPdfFormFill

This tool takes a PDF form and fills it with data found in an xlsx file.
It creates a single PDF file for each row of data in the xlsx and takes a naming variable from the xlsx.

It also offers the reverse, i.e., extracting PDF form data from multiple PDFs in one folder.

It' primarily a GUI for the excellent PDFTK tool.

Works in conjunction with MAPI Massmailer (https://github.com/cataclysmic/MAPI_massmailer).
